## Usage

### Installation

To setup the project locally, you need to meet the following requirements:
* Git
* NodeJS (Version ^17, prefer installation using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
* PNPM (Version ^7 recommended, install with `npm i -g pnpm`)

Once everything is installed, you can clone the project locally with the following command:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:Zuruuh/{{name}}
cd {{name}}
```
Then, install all the npm dependencies with `pnpm install`.

### Development
To run the project locally, use the npm script *dev* with `pnpm run dev`, and the project will be served locally at http://localhost:5173.
You will benefit from ViteJS Hot Module Replacement which will update all your code directly in your browser when you edit it.

### Production
To build the project for production, simply run `pnpm run build` and you will get your prod-ready project in the *./dist* folder.
